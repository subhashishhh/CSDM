# Common Semantic Data Model (CSDM) 2020-2023
The amount of data collected in the electronic healthcare record (EHR) about an individual’s health state has grown exponentially over recent decades. Access to EHR information is no longer required solely in secondary care clinics and hospitals, but are also needed by the individual service user and their families, healthcare organizations and primary care teams to deliver self-management support in the home. The relationships between the systems which provide access to data and the actors who access the data from the systems needs to be carefully designed to understand the relational effect and impact between humans and non- humans’ agents such as IoT. In this diverse data enrich healthcare network. Actor-Network Theory (ANT) helps us to distinguish how one-factor may influence others within a social process workflow. Specifically, ANT can contribute to understanding how inanimate entities (IoT) can effect and impact on the social process of care and associated impact on behavioral change. But ANT can only provide one aspect of understanding this complex process in context . It does not provide a solution for integration of multiple sources of data across a diverse range of resources which is considered the main challenge. Standard-based approaches try to solve the data heterogeneity problem by enforcing all stakeholders engaged in service delivery to use the same specifications and techniques. Realistically, such an approach is proving challenging and complex . To achieve interoperability across one to many platforms by transforming all data to a single standard capturing all features, properties, and data fields in single schema model is multifaceted and involves a number of stakeholders. In this proposal, a **Common Semantic Data Model (CSDM)** for complex Healthcare Network, we propose a hybrid approach to tackle the complexity based on two popular standards, FHIR and OMOP to accommodate maximum amount data fields in every aspect of healthcare experiment.



# Common Semantic Standardized Data Model (CSSDM) 2024-2026
With the advent of digital platforms, people are now becoming increasingly dependent on
technology-driven home-based solutions, through which they want to monitor their health
condition alongside sharing information with healthcare professionals in case of need. For
implementing an efficient care plan management system, sole analysis of acute hospital
summary and clinical care’s electronic health records (EHRs) is not enough. Other
components like individual user needs and social settings (i.e. social determinants of health)
should adequately be considered. This includes individual living conditions, as well as
healthcare information flow from one healthcare setting (primary care) to other healthcare
settings (home care). The main challenges, in this information-rich complex labyrinth of
healthcare networks, can broadly be categorized in two parts. The first addresses the diversity
in schema (i.e. EHR, personal health record (PHR)), and the second focuses on the diversity in
terminology (e.g. ICD, SNOMED) used among ancillary healthcare operations like service
delivery, laboratory test, and health insurance system. Establishing interoperability among
different healthcare systems and applications is a primary concern. The European
Interoperability Framework (EIF) recommendation provide evidence for urgent requirement
of patient-centric, access and control of healthcare data models. Compliant architecture is
utmost necessary. “The lack of interoperability is a major obstacle to progress on the digital
single market”- EIF. This proposal aims to develop a Common Semantic Standardized Data
Model (CSSDM) to achieve Interoperability in Continuity of care Network, based on three
popular standards, ISO 13940:2016 ContSys, ASTM E2369-12 Continuity of Care Record (CCR)
& HL7 FHIR. CSSDM will help to fulfill the EU vision of the European Health Data Space (EHDS).
